* Objectified version of the plugin. Moved all white listing related code from 
  helper module into separate class WhiteLister. Left previous API in place, 
  so that old test files pass unchanged, this will ensure backward 
  compatibility to some extent. Also, copied and rewritten old tests to cover 
  WhiteLister class. [Dima Sabanin, sdmitry@gmail.com]
