      Hello 
      = current_reader.name
    Thank you very much for persevering with the registration process. Your account is now active.

    - if session[:return_to]
      %p 
        Would you like to 
        = link_to ("return to the page you were looking at before you started registering", session[:return_to]) + '?'
    
  - content_for :pagetitle do
    Welcome!

- else

      Please check your email.
      - if current_reader
        We have sent a message to 
        %strong
          = current_reader.email
        containing a link that will automatically activate your account and log you in. If you can't find the message, we can 
        = link_to("send it again", new_password_reset_url) + ':'
        just put your email address in the password reminder form.
      - else
        You should have received a message 
        containing a link that will automatically activate your account and log you in. If you can't find the message, we can 
        = link_to("send it again", resend_activation_reader_url(current_reader)) + '.'
      
    %p
      If you think you might have put the wrong email address in, the easiest thing to do is 
      = link_to 'register again', new_reader_url
      with the right one. The failed registration attempt will be purged after a couple of days.
